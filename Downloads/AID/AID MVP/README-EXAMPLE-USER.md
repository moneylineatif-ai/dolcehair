# Example User Account

## Login Credentials

**Email:** `Aid@gmail.com`  
**Password:** `123`  
**Role:** `customer`

## How to Create the User

### Option 1: Using the Node.js Script (Recommended)

Make sure your PostgreSQL database is running, then:

```bash
cd server
npm run create-user
```

Or directly:
```bash
npx tsx server/scripts/create-example-user.ts
```

### Option 2: Using the Registration API

You can also register this user through the signup page at `/signup`:
- Email: `Aid@gmail.com`
- Password: `123`
- Name: `AID User`
- Role: `Customer`

### Option 3: Manual SQL Insert

If you prefer to insert directly into PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Connect to your database
psql -U postgres -d aid_mvp

-- Run this (password hash will be generated by bcrypt in the app)
-- Note: You'll need to generate the bcrypt hash for password "123"
-- The easiest way is to use the Node.js script above
```

## Testing the Login

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/login

3. Enter:
   - Email: `Aid@gmail.com`
   - Password: `123`

4. Click "Sign In"

You should be redirected to the map view (since role is `customer`).

## Notes

- The password "123" is less than 6 characters, so if you use the registration API, you'll need to modify the validation or use a longer password.
- The script handles password hashing automatically using bcrypt.
- If the user already exists, the script will inform you and exit gracefully.
